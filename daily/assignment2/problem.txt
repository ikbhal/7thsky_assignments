 Speech recognition is gradually becoming a part of our lives in the form of voice assistants such as Alexa,
  Google Assistant, and Siri. Whether it’s dictating words to your device to compose a document, 
  doing a web search using voice, or controlling your computer using speech
   — speech to text conversion is making our life faster and comfortable.

Advantage:
    life faster and comfortable.
